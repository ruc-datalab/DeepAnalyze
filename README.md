**DeepAnalyze** is the first agentic LLM for autonomous data science. It can autonomously complete a wide range of data-centric tasks without human intervention, supporting:
- 🛠 **Entire data science pipeline**: Data preparation, data analysis, Data modeling, data visualization, and report generation.
- 🔍 **Open-ended data research**: Explore diverse data sources and produce high-quality, analyst-grade research reports.
- 📊 **Various data types**: Handle structured data (Databases, CSV, Excel), semi-structured data (JSON, XML, YAML), and unstructured data (TXT, Markdown).


> [!TIP]
>
> You can directly deploy DeepAnalyze on your local system as your data analyst to complete any data science tasks without the need to design any workflow or Closed-source API.
